                        The recent release of Bullet incorporates pybullet for robotics, deep learning, VR and haptics, in collaboration
                        with Google brain team. As for the PGS LCP constraint solver, it has a new option to terminate as soon as the
                        residual (error) is below a specified tolerance (instead of fixed number of iterations). There is also support
                        to load some MuJoCo MJCF xml files. Bullet 2.87 added reinforcement learning environment to allow the user of 
                        pybullet inside Unity 3D for robotics and reinforcement learning.

                        Bullet Physics is a professional open source collision detection, rigid body and soft body dynamics library.  
                        Bullet relaxes the friction model to make solution by projected Gauss-Seidel possible. Bullet's strength is 
                        in its recent developments for parallel computation. Collision detection and physics solutions can run entirely 
                        on a GPU without needing to communicate with a CPU.  The recently released Bullet 2.80 includes a preview of 
                        the GPU OpenCL rigid body pipeline. Collision detection and physics have been optimized to run on multiple
                        parallel processors. By using a special collision dispatcher, the code can activate parallel optimizations.

                        Chrono is a physics-based modelling and simulation infrastructure based on a platform-independent, open-source design.
                        The core of Chrono is the Chrono::Engine middleware, an object-oriented library whose C++ API can be used to develop
                        simulation software. Among the other components of the Chrono ecosystems are: Chrono::Parallel, a library for enabling
                        parallel computation in Chrono; Chrono::Vehicle, which provides support for vehicle dynamics simulation; Chrono::FEA,
                        which provides support for linear and nonlinear Finite Element Analysis; Chrono::FSI, which provides support for
                        Fluid-Solid Interaction problems; Chrono::PyEngine, which enables one to use Chrono::Engine in Python; Chrono::SolidWorks,
                        an add-in for SolidWorks, which can be used to export 3D models and geometries from a CAD file into Chrono.
                        Chrono is released under a permissive BSD3 license.

                        ProjectChrono is a set of open-source tools for mechanical simulations.  The core of ProjectChrono is the Chrono::Engine
                        C++ middleware, a powerful object-oriented set of libraries and their application program interface (API) can be freely 
                        used to develop simulation software. There are impressive simulation videos of many-body dynamics and they take advantage
                        of the GPU and CPU parallelization. The physical contact model in Chrono::Engine is based a cone complementarity problem (CCP)
                        with relaxation and stablization terms in the formulation.

                        This engine is based on the work of Anitescu and Tasora.  See <a href="http://ied.unipr.it/tasora/projects/gpu/index.html"> Tasora's 
                        mechanical system simulation page</a> for pictures and technical papers on the methods.  
                        The basic model is the complementarity problem similar to the engines described on this page, 
                        but it is modified to take the form of a second-order cone constrained optimization problem (SOCCOP).  
                        It is solved with a matrix-free method.  They have simulated up to about 1,000,000 bodies coupled through 
                        contact on Tesla GPUs.  To form the SOCCOP, the friction model is regularized with the undesirable side 
                        effect being the physical formation of gaps at all sliding contacts.

                        <br> DART is accurate and stable for especially humanoid robot simulation, due to its use of generalized coordinates
                        to represent articulated rigid body systems and Featherstoneâ€™s Articulated Body Algorithm to compute the dynamics
                        of motion. DART has been fully integrated with Gazebo, together with ODE and Simbody. DART supports dynamics systems
                        with closed-loop structure. DART handles contacts and collisions using an implicit LCP to guarantee non-penetration,
                        directional friction, and approximated Coulomb friction cone condition.

                        applications in robotics and computer animation. DART uses generalized coordinates to represent articulated
                        rigid body systems and computes Lagrange's equations derived from D'Alembert's principle to describe the
                        dynamics of motion.  The contact and collision are handled using an implicit time-stepping, velocity-based
                        linear complementarity problem (LCP) to guarantee non-penetration, directional friction and approximated Coulomb's
                        friction cone conditions. The LCP problem is solved by Lemke's algorithm.

                        It is capable of simulating a population of robots, sensors and objects, but does so in a  three-dimensional world. It 
                        generates both realistic sensor feedback and physically plausible interactions between objects. Moreover, Gazebo is in 
                        the process to support other physics engines; right now, Gazebo supports 4 physics engines: <a href="http://www.ode.org/">ODE</a>,

                        This library supports the physically-based simulation of mechanical effects. In the last years position-based
                        simulation methods have become popular in the graphics community. In contrast to classical simulation
                        approaches these methods compute the position changes in each simulation step directly, based on the
                        solution of a quasi-static problem. Therefore, position-based approaches are fast, stable and controllable
                        which make them well-suited for use in interactive environments. However, these methods are generally not
                        as accurate as force-based methods but still provide visual plausibility. Hence, the main application areas
                        of position-based simulation are virtual reality, computer games and special effects in movies and commercials.

                        The PositionBasedDynamics library allows the position-based handling of many types of constraints in a
                        physically-based simulation. Position-Based Dynamics is now
                        <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/PositionBasedDynamics"> open-source on github</a>.

                        These comments are based on my reading of the 2006 paper, <a href="http://i31www.ira.uka.de/docs/PaperFinal.pdf">
                            "Constraint-based collision and contact handling using impulses"</a>.  In one time-step, this simulator identifies 
                        all imminent collisions and existing contacts.  Then it executes two main steps.  First, it iterates through all 
                        collisions to find impulses consistent with Newton's restitution model. Second it processes the sustained contacts, 
                        iteratively until it finds impulses that prevent penetration.  The first part is done in a way very similar to what 
                        Mirtich implemented in Impulse.  The second is similar to the Euler approximation of the dynamic equations used in 
                        velocity-level complementarity methods.  The two iterative phases are essentially fixed-point iteration schemes 
                        applied in a Gauss-Seidel fashion.  A benefit is that implementation as an any-time method is possible. 
                        The videos are impressive.

                        MBSim represents a universal simulation tool for multibody systems. The main focus of this software is the efficient
                        treatment of unilateral and bilateral rigid contacts to calculate nonsmooth dynamics. As integration method amongst
                        others modern time stepping methods are available in MBSim. The created models can be visualized by an interface to OpenMBV. 

                        The kernel of MBSim was developed at the Institute within a dissertation and is provided under the GNU General

                        This project is being developed by the Center for Applied Mechanics at Technical University of Munich.  It uses 
                        prox function formulations of the time-stepping subproblems to properly handle unilateral contacts with quadratic 
                        Coulomb friction.  One drawback is that collision detection is not general.  Pairs of geometric primitives are 
                        manually chosen for contact monitoring.

                        ODE use the maximal coordinate solver: Projected Gauss Seidel (PGS), and the default maximum number of iterations in 
                        PGS solver is 40. Once it runs out of the maximum, the loop terminates with the solution from the last iteration. To
                        my knowledge, there is no tracking of the best solution in the loop.  Now <a href = "http://gazebosim.org/"> Gazebo </a>
                        calls the PGS solver in ODE when solving the subproblems during each time step.

                        The friction models are <i>not</i> Coulomb friction.  The user can choose one of two approximations that make the 
                        time-stepping subproblem (an LCP) much easier to solve, but at the expense of some accuracy. There are several LCP 
                        solvers available in ODE.  I like the documentation.

                        RPI-MATLAB-Simulator (RPISim) is a physics engine and simulator in MATLAB. RPISim is aimed at building a modular simulator 
                        for both teaching and research. RPISim contains multiple joint constraints such as revolute, prismatic, spherical and so on.
                        Collision detection, modeling, dynamics formulation, solution algorithms are independent modules, so RPISim provide users 
                        a flexible platform to simulate multibody dynamics. Besides, the linear complementarity problem, nonlinear complementarity 
                        problem and mixed complementarity problem are all supported in RPISim. Furthermore, there are pivoting and iterative 
                        algorithms to solve these problems. In order to fairly compare the performance of different algorithms, there is a Benchmark 
                        Problems for Multibody Dynamics (BPMD) framework. BPMD framework is open source and use the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) 
                        BPMD database to compare the solution algorithms.

                        RBDL supports new constraint type CustomConstraint, which is a versatile interface to define more general types of constraints.
                        It also adds support to specify external forces on bodies on constrained forward dynamics. RBDL added support for closed-loop
                        models by replacing Contacts API by a new Constraint AP, in a most recent release in 2018, with the second latest update in 2016.

                        Rigid Body Dynamics Library(RBDL) performs the dynamics computation in a very efficient manner for models using 
                        generalized coordinates. It uses Featherstone's Spatial Algebra and allows for efficient evaluation of forward 
                        and inverse dynamics using the Articulated Body Algorithm and the Recursive Newton Euler Algorithm. RBDL also has 
                        implementation of methods to compute collisions and bilateral contact forces.

                        Simbody uses an advanced Featherstone-style formulation of rigid body mechanics to provide results in Order(n) time
                        for any set of n generalized coordinates. This can be used for internal coordinate modeling of molecules, or for coarse-grained
                        models based on larger chunks. It is also useful for large-scale mechanical models, such as neuromuscular models of human gait,
                        robotics, avatars, and animation. Simbody can also be used in real time interactive applications for biosimulation as well as
                        for virtual worlds and games.

                        Siconos is one of the simulators that supports the nonsmooth multibody dynamics system with unilateral contact and Coulomb
                        friction. Siconos supports various formulations (LCP, NCP, QP, ...) with dedicated solvers for each of the formulation.
                        They have a nonsmooth Gauss-Seidel solver and some LCP solvers can be found here: http://siconos.gforge.inria.fr/users_guide/lcp_solvers.html

                        of penalty methods.  For example, I tried rolling a faceted approximation of a uniform sphere on a plane 
                        and had to try many parameter settings before Solver returned a solution approximating the known exact solution.

                        Falling Bodies is a spring/damper simulator using a reduced degree of freedom model to create a set of ordinary
                        differential equations, which are then integrated forward using both explicit and implicit integrators. Joints
                        are handled by the reduced degree of freedom model using generalized coordinates. Collisions are modeled as
                        exponential springs. Some new techniques, covered by a pending U.S. patent, allow Falling Bodies to deal
                        effectively and reliably with the very stiff numerical systems that result from this formulation. Collision 
                        detection is based on convex polyhedra, with a distance measure using the GJK algorithm front-ended by an
                        axis-oriented bounding box system.

                        Most other simulators for animation and games use an impulse/constraint approach. It's inherent in the impulse/constraint
                        approach that collisions result in instantaneous changes in direction and velocity. That looks subtly wrong;
                        light and heavy objects bounce the same way, and the viewer doesn't get the impression of weight when a heavy object hits.
                        We call this the "boink problem". Our approach, using nonlinear springs to simulate collisions, provides a more accurate
                        simulation; heavy and light objects bounce differently. This, incidentally, is why Falling Bodies is slower than some of
                        the competitive products. Now that 1GHz PCs are shipping, this is much less of a problem than it used to be.

                        <br>
                        According to John Nagel of Animats, Falling Bodies, mentioned below, has been licensed to Havok for 
                        the past five years.
                        <br><font size="2"><i>04/01/2010.</i></font><br>
                        The Animats web page is still under active development.  Of interest is that they have patented at least 
                        two algorithms: (Patent 1) "Robots which can run up hills without slipping are usually covered by this patent."  
                        This patent appears to be based on a control method that reduces the magnitudes of the friction forces needed 
                        to prevent foot slip. (Patent 2) "This broad patent covers most spring/damper character simulation systems. 
                        If it falls, it has joints, it looks right, and it works right, it's usually covered by our patent."  My
                        interpretation of the patent is that they use a penalty method that begins responding in before the bodies 
                        are in contact and grows quickly to ensure that penetration never occurs.
                        <br><font size="2"><i>01/09/2010.</i></font><br>

                        The Falling Bodies software takes a spring/damper approach with a Featherstone-type approach to articulated 
                        characters, but with very careful handling of the details (SDFast is used to generate C-code from Featherstone's 
                        algorithm).  It slows down on difficult collisions, but eventually grinds its way through them.

                        Animations are done by key-framing, which would imply that
                        there are no built-in rigid body dynamics algorithms.
                        I was unable to find impressive videos that I saw 8 years ago here.

                        DynaWiz has been updated to allow unilateral contacts to occur during
                        run-time. Here is a quote from the web page about solution the
                        complexity of their time-stepping method: "Order(N + sum(n_i^3)),
                        where N = number of bodies, and n_i^3 = number of flexible modes for
                        the i-th body."  The implication here is that unilateral contacts
                        are treated as permanently connected.  If an LCP (or NCP) formulation
                        were employed, then there should be another term in the complexity
                        expression; something like O(n_c^3), where n_c is the number of
                        unilateral contacts.

                        DynaWiz formulates multibody dynamics in
                        Lagrangian form, and provisions are made for event detection.
                        However, in the introductory web pages, there is no
                        description of how rigid-rigid contacts are handled.  A
                        direct communication with CDI indicated that DynaWiz does not
                        support unilateral rigid contacts.  The user would have to insert
                        his own solvers.  <br>

                        But after a quick search around, I found the NVIDIA GPUGems has a demo to solve the complementarity

                        won't find is that when Ageia originally developed the engine,
                        it was based on the impulse-velocity time-stepping formulations
                        of Stewart-Trinkle and Anitescu-Potra.  So friction and
                        intermittency of contact was handled with the framework of
                        complementarity problems.  I don't know how much of this has
                        been retained in the Nvidia product.

                        Tokamak features a unique iterative method for solving constraints. This is claimed to allow developers to make
                        trade-offs between accuracy and speed and provides more predictable processor and memory usage. Tokamak's
                        constraint solver does not involve solving large matrices, thereby avoiding memory bandwidth limitations on some game consoles.

                        The SDK supports a variety of joint types and joint limits and a realistic friction model. Tokamak is optimized for
                        stacking large numbers of objects - a frequently requested feature by game developers. Tokamak provides collision
                        detection for primitives (box, sphere, capsule), combinations of primitives, and arbitrary static triangle meshes.
                        Lightweight 'rigid particles' provide particle effects in games at minimal cost.

                        Specialized for rigid body dynamics with unilateral, frictional contacts.  However, dry friction does not obey Coulomb's Law.  
                        There are three choices, zero friction, infinite friction, and "box" friction.  Box friction is simple limits on the tangential 
                        force values in two directions - no dependency on the normal load.  A first-order semi-implicit time-stepper is used.  The 
                        contact constraints are likely to be formulated as a complementarity problem, since it is possible to get a warning about cycling
                        during constraint solution.  The solver is at least partially based on algorithms to solve complementarity problems.  The
                        demos are impressive.

                        Recently updated the binary version which is available for Windows with installer. The entire DANCE system is 
                        now open with all source code included. It supports the import/export of motion capture with easy plugin interface. 
                        Physical simulation of characters with dynamic control and pose-based dynamic control is available for DANCE. 
                        Besides, it has also been integrated with the Open Dynamics Engine(ODE).

                        This is a multibody dynamics simulator based on SD/Fast and targeted at animation applications.  It appears 
                        as though rigid-rigid contacts are supported through "actuator plug-ins," which can be implemented as a penalty method.

                        dVC3d is a physical simulation engine that focuses on accurate robotics application and testing of different 
                        cutting edge theories in physical simulation. Theoretically, it inherits the basic framework from dVC2Dd. Beside 
                        moving completely to 3D, dVC3d also integrates research works developed recently.

                        I can't find anything about unilateral contacts on the web page, but I learned from David Orin that unilateral
                        contacts for a walking machine were implement using a penalty method.

                        Brian Mirtich's Impulse does rigid body simulation with nothing but collisions.  A hybrid version was developed to
                        combined impulse with joint constraints.  While at MERL Mirtich added a
                        <a href="http://www.merl.com/projects/rigidBodySim/"> "time-warp"</a> feature to avoid the crippling  bottleneck
                        caused by synchronous processing for large numbers of bodies.

                        Moby has not been updated since 2012.
                        <br><font size="2"><i>05/07/2018.</i></font>

                        Moby contains multiple joint constraints such as revolute, prismatic, spherical and so on. Besides, two optional 
                        convex solving methods incorporated in Moby are fast(active set QP-based) solver and accurate(interior-point 
                        quadratically constrained quadratic program-based) solver. Multiple integrator types are supported and thanks to 
                        the plugin of ODEPACK, the time stepper in Moby can now be variable step. Articulated bodies are supported
                        using both independent coordinate and absolute coordinate representations. 

                        <br><font size="2"><i>01/01/2013.</i></font><br>

                        Moby uses the Anitescu/Potra time-stepping method augmented with Baumgarte stabilization for the bilateral constraints.
                        No stabilization is used for the unilateral constraints, which means that unilateral constraints are added to the 
                        time-stepping subproblems as penetrations occur, and no attempt is made to correct these penetrations.  This means 
                        that penetrations are controlled using an event-driven approach that adjusts the time steps to find the time when 
                        each contact occurs.  Several LCP methods have been incorporated: Lemke, Lemke with Yamane's modification, and PATH.

                        A haptic interface allows real-time interaction with a virtual environments as long as the number of degrees of
                        freedom and number of steady contacts is not too large.

                        law (Signorini-Coulomb) is solved by means of a nonlinear Gauss-Seidel or a projected quasi-Newton method. 
                        Rigid, pseudo-rigid and finite element kinematics is included.

                        Umbra development has intensified.  Michael Skroch, manager of the group developing Umbra, said, "I have 
                        been focusing on Umbra being useful for the nexus of physical-cyber-behavior concepts in a 3D embodied environment.   
                        We've started work on parallelizing Umbra and providing multi-thread enhancements.  We also are working with GPUs 
                        to improve speed."

                        Umbra is a general simulation and visualization environment developed by Fred Oppel and Eric Gottlieb at Sandia National
                        Laboratories.  It contains a rigid body dynamics module developed by Eric Gottlieb with technical guidance from Florian 
                        Potra and Jeff Trinkle.  The time-stepping algorithm is based on the Stewart-Trinkle LCP formulation (in terms of 
                        velocities and impulses). All the videos on this web page were produced with Umbra.  Even though there is currently no 
                        impact law is implemented, bouncing behavior can be observed in the animations.  This is simply a side effect of the 
                        constraint stabilization in the Stewart-Trinkle algorithm.  Many enhancements are underway.
