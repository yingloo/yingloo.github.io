                        Bullet Physics is a professional open source collision detection, rigid body and soft body dynamics library.  
                        Bullet relaxes the friction model to make solution by projected Gauss-Seidel possible. Bullet's strength is 
                        in its recent developments for parallel computation. Collision detection and physics solutions can run entirely 
                        on a GPU without needing to communicate with a CPU.  The recently released Bullet 2.80 includes a preview of 
                        the GPU OpenCL rigid body pipeline. Collision detection and physics have been optimized to run on multiple
                        parallel processors. By using a special collision dispatcher, the code can activate parallel optimizations.

                        ProjectChrono is a set of open-source tools for mechanical simulations.  The core of ProjectChrono is the Chrono::Engine
                        C++ middleware, a powerful object-oriented set of libraries and their application program interface (API) can be freely 
                        used to develop simulation software. There are impressive simulation videos of many-body dynamics and they take advantage
                        of the GPU and CPU parallelization. The physical contact model in Chrono::Engine is based a cone complementarity problem (CCP)
                        with relaxation and stablization terms in the formulation.

                        This engine is based on the work of Anitescu and Tasora.  See <a href="http://ied.unipr.it/tasora/projects/gpu/index.html"> Tasora's 
                            mechanical system simulation page</a> for pictures and technical papers on the methods.  
                        The basic model is the complementarity problem similar to the engines described on this page, 
                        but it is modified to take the form of a second-order cone constrained optimization problem (SOCCOP).  
                        It is solved with a matrix-free method.  They have simulated up to about 1,000,000 bodies coupled through 
                        contact on Tesla GPUs.  To form the SOCCOP, the friction model is regularized with the undesirable side 
                        effect being the physical formation of gaps at all sliding contacts.

                        <br> Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkits (DART) is an open source library for developing kinematic and dynamic
                        applications in robotics and computer animation. DART uses generalized coordinates to represent articulated
                        rigid body systems and computes Lagrange's equations derived from D'Alembert's principle to describe the
                        dynamics of motion.  The contact and collision are handled using an implicit time-stepping, velocity- based
                        linear complementarity problem (LCP) to guarantee non-penetration, directional friction and approximated Coulomb's
                        friction cone conditions. The LCP problem is solved by Lemke's algorithm.

                        <a href= "http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/TTO/Programs/DARPA_Robotics_Challenge.aspx">Darpa Robotics Challenge (DRC)</a>. 
                        It is capable of simulating a population of robots, sensors and objects, but does so in a  three-dimensional world. It 
                        generates both realistic sensor feedback and physically plausible interactions between objects. Moreover, Gazebo is in 
                        the process to support other physics engines; right now, Gazebo supports 4 physics engines: <a href="http://www.ode.org/">ODE</a>,

                        <br>
                        These comments are based on my reading of the 2006 paper, <a href="http://i31www.ira.uka.de/docs/PaperFinal.pdf">
                            "Constraint-based collision and contact handling using impulses"</a>.  In one time-step, this simulator identifies 
                        all imminent collisions and existing contacts.  Then it executes two main steps.  First, it iterates through all 
                        collisions to find impulses consistent with Newton's restitution model. Second it processes the sustained contacts, 
                        iteratively until it finds impulses that prevent penetration.  The first part is done in a way very similar to what 
                        Mirtich implemented in Impulse.  The second is similar to the Euler approximation of the dynamic equations used in 
                        velocity-level complementarity methods.  The two iterative phases are essentially fixed-point iteration schemes 
                        applied in a Gauss-Seidel fashion.  A benefit is that implementation as an any-time method is possible. 
                        The videos are impressive.

                        This project is being developed by the Center for Applied Mechanics at Technical University of Munich.  It uses 
                        prox function formulations of the time-stepping subproblems to properly handle unilateral contacts with quadratic 
                        Coulomb friction.  One drawback is that collision detection is not general.  Pairs of geometric primitives are 
                        manually chosen for contact monitoring.

                        Moby contains multiple joint constraints such as revolute, prismatic, spherical and so on. Besides, two optional 
                        convex solving methods incorporated in Moby are fast(active set QP-based) solver and accurate(interior-point 
                        quadratically constrained quadratic program-based) solver. Multiple integrator types are supported and thanks to 
                        the plugin of ODEPACK, the time stepper in Moby can now be variable step. Articulated bodies are supported
                        using both independent coordinate and absolute coordinate representations.

                        Moby uses the Anitescu/Potra time-stepping method augmented with Baumgarte stabilization for the bilateral constraints.
                        No stabilization is used for the unilateral constraints, which means that unilateral constraints are added to the 
                        time-stepping subproblems as penetrations occur, and no attempt is made to correct these penetrations.  This means 
                        that penetrations are controlled using an event-driven approach that adjusts the time steps to find the time when 
                        each contact occurs.  Several LCP methods have been incorporated: Lemke, Lemke with Yamane's modification, and PATH.

                        ODE use the maximal coordinate solver: Projected Gauss Seidel (PGS), and the default maximum number of iterations in 
                        PGS solver is 40. Once it runs out of the maximum, the loop terminates with the solution from the last iteration. To
                        my knowledge, there is no tracking of the best solution in the loop.  Now <a href = "http://gazebosim.org/"> Gazebo </a>
                        calls the PGS solver in ODE when solving the subproblems during each time step.

                        The friction models are <i>not</i> Coulomb friction.  The user can choose one of two approximations that make the 
                        time-stepping subproblem (an LCP) much easier to solve, but at the expense of some accuracy. There are several LCP 
                        solvers available in ODE.  I like the documentation.

                        Free software still under development from Russell Smith who worked at Math Engine.  The method of integration is 
                        based on complementarity formulations of Stewart/Trinkle and Anitescu/Potra.  The solver is based on Baraff's 
                        pivoting method.  Collisions are handled following Mirtich's method.

                        RPI-MATLAB-Simulator (RPISim) is a physics engine and simulator in MATLAB. RPISim is aimed at building a modular simulator 
                        for both teaching and research. RPISim contains multiple joint constraints such as revolute, prismatic, spherical and so on.
                        Collision detection, modeling, dynamics formulation, solution algorithms are independent modules, so RPISim provide users 
                        a flexible platform to simulate multibody dynamics. Besides, the linear complementarity problem, nonlinear complementarity 
                        problem and mixed complementarity problem are all supported in RPISim. Furthermore, there are pivoting and iterative 
                        algorithms to solve these problems. In order to fairly compare the performance of different algorithms, there is a Benchmark 
                        Problems for Multibody Dynamics (BPMD) framework. BPMD framework is open source and use the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5)

                        Rigid Body Dynamics Library(RBDL) performs the dynamics computation in a very efficient manner for models using 
                        generalized coordinates. It uses Featherstone's Spatial Algebra and allows for efficient evaluation of forward 
                        and inverse dynamics using the Articulated Body Algorithm and the Recursive Newton Euler Algorithm. RBDL also has 
                        implementation of methods to compute collisions and bilateral contact forces.

                        for real-time dynamic simulation in the medical field.  It's been around since 2006-2007, and is developed 
                        by a large team. SOFA includes cluster and GPU support, including using CUDA, and they are working on support 
                        for haptic devices.  The software is very well organized.  There are several collision checkers and dynamic 
                        models (flexible and rigid).  It appears to have good support for finite element methods also.

                        "Adams Solver" solves rigid body contact problems with a penalty method.  It exhibited problems typical 
                        of penalty methods.  For example, I tried rolling a faceted approximation of a uniform sphere on a plane 
                        and had to try many parameter settings before Solver returned a solution approximating the known exact solution.

                        <br>
                        According to John Nagel of Animats, Falling Bodies, mentioned below, has been licensed to Havok for 
                        the past five years.

                        <br><font size="2"><i>04/01/2010.</i></font><br>
                        The Animats web page is still under active development.  Of interest is that they have patented at least 
                        two algorithms: (Patent 1) "Robots which can run up hills without slipping are usually covered by this patent."  
                        This patent appears to be based on a control method that reduces the magnitudes of the friction forces needed 
                        to prevent foot slip. (Patent 2) "This broad patent covers most spring/damper character simulation systems. 
                        If it falls, it has joints, it looks right, and it works right, it's usually covered by our patent."  My
                        interpretation of the patent is that they use a penalty method that begins responding in before the bodies 
                        are in contact and grows quickly to ensure that penetration never occurs.
                        <br><font size="2"><i>01/09/2010.</i></font><br>

                        The Falling Bodies software takes a spring/damper approach with a Featherstone-type approach to articulated 
                        characters, but with very careful handling of the details (SDFast is used to generate C-code from Featherstone's 
                        algorithm).  It slows down on difficult collisions, but eventually grinds its way through them.

                        there are no built-in rigid body dynamics algorithms.
                        I was unable to find impressive videos that I saw 8 years ago here.

                        to be an equal (on paper) to "Total Havok."  Excellent videos.

                        <br>
                        DynaWiz has been updated to allow unilateral contacts to occur during
                        run-time. Here is a quote from the web page about solution the
                        complexity of their time-stepping method: "Order(N + sum(n_i^3)),
                        where N = number of bodies, and n_i^3 = number of flexible modes for
                        the i-th body."  The implication here is that unilateral contacts
                        are treated as permanently connected.  If an LCP (or NCP) formulation
                        were employed, then there should be another term in the complexity
                        expression; something like O(n_c^3), where n_c is the number of
                        unilateral contacts.

                        DynaWiz formulates multibody dynamics in
                        Lagrangian form, and provisions are made for event detection.
                        However, in the introductory web pages, there is no
                        description of how rigid-rigid contacts are handled.  A
                        direct communication with CDI indicated that DynaWiz does not
                        support unilateral rigid contacts.  The user would have to insert
                        his own solvers.  <br>

                        of Stewart-Trinkle and Anitescu-Potra.  So friction and
                        intermittency of contact was handled with the framework of
                        complementarity problems.  I don't know how much of this has
                        been retained in the Nvidia product.

                        Sonar software consists of Sonar_LAB an Sonar_SIM. Sonar_LAB is a tool to create 3-dimensional
                        multibody dynamic models using C#; Sonar_SIM is used to execute the simulation of the models created
                        by means of sonar-3D-LAB. Sonar-SIM supports the multiprocessing standard 'openMP', and it comes with
                        different licenses.  The frictional contact between two rigid bodies is solved using a spring-damping
                        system, without formulation of the complementarity problems.

                        been focusing on Umbra being useful for the nexus of physical-cyber-behavior concepts in a 3D embodied environment.   
                        We've started work on parallelizing Umbra and providing multi-thread enhancements.  We also are working with GPUs 
                        to improve speed."

                        Umbra is a general simulation and visualization environment developed by Fred Oppel and Eric Gottlieb at Sandia National
                        Laboratories.  It contains a rigid body dynamics module developed by Eric Gottlieb with technical guidance from Florian 
                        Potra and Jeff Trinkle.  The time-stepping algorithm is based on the Stewart-Trinkle LCP formulation (in terms of 
                        velocities and impulses). All the videos on this web page were produced with Umbra.  Even though there is currently no 
                        impact law is implemented, bouncing behavior can be observed in the animations.  This is simply a side effect of the 
                        constraint stabilization in the Stewart-Trinkle algorithm.  Many enhancements are underway.

                        Formerly Working Model.  The integration method for rigid body dynamics is a penalty method.  Even though it probably
                        exhibits the usual problems that plague penalty methods, vN4D ran right "out of the box" on a problem in which three
                        parts with about 1500 facets each were dropped onto a plane such that they would collide with each other.  The API 
                        does not provide access to contact point locations and normals, but is schedule to in the next release - Q1 of 2002.

                        Version 3 of Vortex will include "scaled" box friction, which approximates a quadratic friction cone with a

                        over a curb. This can come from an offset in the geometry used for collision detection and that used for visual rendering, 
                        Or it can come from using a penalty approach for contact force resolution.

                        Specialized for rigid body dynamics with unilateral, frictional contacts.  However, dry friction does not obey Coulomb's Law.  
                        There are three choices, zero friction, infinite friction, and "box" friction.  Box friction is simple limits on the tangential 
                        force values in two directions - no dependency on the normal load.  A first-order semi-implicit time-stepper is used.  The 
                        contact constraints are likely to be formulated as a complementarity problem, since it is possible to get a warning about cycling
                        during constraint solution.  The solver is at least partially based on algorithms to solve complementarity problems.  The
                        demos are impressive.

                        is no longer being improved as Francios is developing a more general and flexible library.

                        contact forces.  It also uses a "fixed set of bodies instead of triangular meshes."  Complementarity theory and
                        Baraff's method are mentioned as worthy goals that are not implemented.
